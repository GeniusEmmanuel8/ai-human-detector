# AI vs Human Text Detector

This project detects whether a given text is written by a human or generated by AI, built using a model trained on a labeled dataset. 

## Folders & Files

- `app.py` — Streamlit web app for predictions
- `models/` — Pre-trained models (`svm_model.pkl`, `decision_tree_model.pkl`, `adaboost_model.pkl`) and the TF-IDF vectorizer
- `notebooks/` — Google Colab for data cleaning, model training, and evaluation
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies
